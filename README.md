# Capstone_Individual
### For this assigment, I wrote very simple code that sorts integer arrays in Ascending and Descending order. 
### I developed the code that sorts in ascending order in the Sort_Asc branch, and the code that sorts in Descending order in the Sort_desc branch. I think created pull requests and merged both features into main. 

##this is what i worked on!
